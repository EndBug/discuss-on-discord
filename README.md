## Inputs

Here's the complete list of inputs for this action, also available in the [action.yml](action.yml) file.

    # The link to the message or channel to post messages and create threads in.
    # If a channel link is used, the thread will be created on a new message in
    # that channel. Otherwise, the thread will be created on the linked message.
    # Remember that each message can only have one thread, so if you use a message
    # link, make sure that the message doesn't already have one.
